# OpenMP
Write a parallel C program using OpenMP such that : Given a matrix where every element is either ‘O’ or ‘X’, replace ‘O’ with ‘X’ if surrounded by ‘X’. A ‘O’ (or a set of ‘O’) is considered to be surrounded by ‘X’ if there are ‘X’ at locations just left and just right of it. O’s at the edges will not be replaced
